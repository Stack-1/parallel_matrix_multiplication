# Prallel Matrix Multiplication
This repository contains the code implemented for the SCPA(Sistemi di Calcolo Parallelo e Applicazioni - PCSA Parallel Computing Systems and Applications) class. The goal of this project is to use MPI, OpnMP and CUDA to measure the performances of a matrix by matrix multiplication.
